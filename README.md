Simple weather app devolped using raw HTML,CSS,JS. 
This was just a practise to use APIs and fetch with promises.

### Some improvement that can be made
- Add dynamic background with the current weather and time.
- code desgin and naming could be better but since I though I will never come back to it I didnt bother.
